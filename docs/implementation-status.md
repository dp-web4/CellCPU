- Timer and interrupt macros
```

### 2. Missing Dependencies
```c
// Reference to non-existent include:
#include "../Shared/Shared.h"  // May need to be resolved

// Constants referenced but may need definition:
- MSG_CELL_TEMP_I2C_OK
- VUART_BIT_TICKS timing constant
```

### 3. Timing Validation
```c
// Should be validated on actual hardware:
- 5Œºs I2C bit delay (I2CBitDelay)
- 20ms ADC settling time
- VUART bit timing accuracy
```
