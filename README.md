# CellCPU Documentation

**ModBatt Battery Management System - Individual Cell Controller**

## Overview

The CellCPU is a **production-ready** foundational component of ModBatt's hierarchical battery management system, providing individual cell monitoring and control for lithium-ion battery applications. Each CellCPU manages a single cell with precision voltage monitoring, temperature sensing, and active balancing control.

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **Complete and functional** - All core modules implemented with sophisticated interrupt-driven architecture.

### Quick Facts

- **Target Platform**: ATtiny45 microcontroller (8-bit AVR)
- **Cell Interface**: Direct monitoring of single lithium-ion cell
- **Temperature Sensor**: MCP9843 precision digital sensor
- **Communication**: Virtual UART at 20kbps in daisy-chain topology
- **Power Consumption**: <1mA typical operation
- **Scalability**: Up to 94 CellCPUs per ModuleCPU

## Web4 Ecosystem Context

CellCPU is the foundational layer of a **trust-native battery management system** demonstrating [Web4](https://github.com/dp-web4/web4) principles in production embedded hardware:

**Philosophy**: [Synchronism](https://github.com/dp-web4/Synchronism) - Distributed intelligence and scale-based autonomy
**Standard**: [Web4](https://github.com/dp-web4/web4) - Trust-native internet architecture with LCTs and MRH
**Implementation**: **CellCPU** (this) → [ModuleCPU](https://github.com/dp-web4/ModuleCPU) → [Pack-Controller](https://github.com/dp-web4/Pack-Controller-EEPROM)

### Web4 Integration

Each CellCPU operates as an autonomous agent with:
- **LCT Identity**: Unforgeable blockchain binding via hardware serial number
- **Markov Blanket**: VUART interface hides internal complexity from ModuleCPU
- **Local Intelligence**: Autonomous decision-making (balancing, error detection)
- **Trust Tensors**: ModuleCPU tracks T3 (Talent/Training/Temperament) and V3 (Veracity/Validity/Value)
- **Witnessed Presence**: ModuleCPU witnesses cell existence via VUART communication

See [WEB4_INTEGRATION.md](WEB4_INTEGRATION.md) for complete Web4 architecture details.

### Synchronism Principles

CellCPU demonstrates cosmic-to-silicon philosophy:
- **Scale-Based Autonomy**: Cell makes local decisions within module context
- **Markov Blankets**: VUART interface defines cell's reality boundary
- **Distributed Intelligence**: No central cell controller - intelligence emerges from hierarchy
- **Sensor Fusion**: Temperature + voltage + time → emergent "cell health"
- **Intent Dynamics**: Battery charge/discharge as metabolic intent propagation

See [SYNCHRONISM_PRINCIPLES.md](SYNCHRONISM_PRINCIPLES.md) for philosophical depth.
